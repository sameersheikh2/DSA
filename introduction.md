# What is Data Structure

 - the data structure is a way of storing and managing our data to use it effectively and efficiently. it is use to minimize space and time complexity. 

 # What is Algorithm

  - the algorithm is a set of instructions/ operations performed in a step-by-step manner to solve a set of problems or execute a task. 

# Time & Space Complexity
 
1. Time complexity - it measures the amount of time required to execute the code.
2. Space complexity - it means how much space is required to successfully execute the code.
